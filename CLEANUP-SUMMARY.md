# Backend Connection Cleanup Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **AuthContext Cleanup**
   - Removed fallback/fake authentication code from `AuthContextV2.jsx`
   - Ensured only backend authentication is used
   - Removed unnecessary duplicate methods

2. **Data Fetching Re-enabled**
   - Uncommented all data fetching functions in `useData.js`
   - Enabled the useEffect hooks to fetch data on component mount:
     - `fetchPlayers()`
     - `fetchPets()`
     - `fetchItems()`
     - `fetchShopItems()`
     - `fetchPlayer()` (when playerId is available)

3. **API Service Restored**
   - Uncommented all API calls in `api.js`
   - Removed mock/stub implementations returning empty arrays or objects
   - Enabled actual backend API calls for:
     - Users/Players
     - Pets
     - Items
     - Search functionality

4. **Import Cleanup**
   - Updated `App.jsx` to use the correct component imports:
     - `Players` instead of `PlayersV2`
     - `Pets` instead of `PetsV2`
     - `Items` instead of `ItemsV2`
   - Updated route definitions to match the new imports

5. **File Cleanup**
   - Executed `clean-fake-data.bat` script
   - Verified that most V2 files have already been renamed to their original names
   - Confirmed `mockData.js` has been removed

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Authentication**
   - Login with valid credentials from the backend
   - Verify the authentication token is stored
   - Verify user data is correctly displayed

2. **Check Data Loading**
   - Open the Players page and verify players are loaded from the backend
   - Open the Pets page and verify pets are loaded from the backend
   - Open the Items page and verify items are loaded from the backend
   - Ensure no errors appear in the console

3. **Check Operations**
   - Create a new player/pet/item and verify it's saved to the backend
   - Update existing data and verify changes are saved
   - Delete an item and verify it's removed from the backend

## Notes

- The application now exclusively uses the backend API for all operations
- All localStorage-based authentication fallbacks have been removed
- The app requires a running backend on `http://localhost:8080/api` to function
- If backend connection issues occur, check API_BASE_URL in `api.js` and ensure the backend server is running

## Remaining Tasks

- Verify that all components work correctly with the backend
- Remove any debug console logs after thorough testing
- Consider adding better error handling for backend connection issues
